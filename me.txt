My name is Makayla Baldwin. I attend Cleveland Community College, I am majoring in Web Administration and Design. One day I hope to create a career out of what I am learning in this course, it would be my dream job. I am engaged and will be getting married April 20th to my fiance Jaden. I have been with Jaden for 4 years (we met at the end of middle school.) I am so excited to begin my life as both a wife and a hopeful web designer. One day I will be the best web designer that I can possibly be!
